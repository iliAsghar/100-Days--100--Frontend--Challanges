## 📖 Description

This project is a clone of Twitter's "Follow Suggestion" page, featuring a theme toggle button. Throughout this project, I utilized various techniques such as custom components, APIs, fetch requests, and theme switching. It was an engaging project, and I believe I performed well.

## 🎯 Project Goals

To work around with some cool methods. Basically, to learn! :)

## 🛠 Challenges Faced

Nathin' much.

## 📚 What I Learned

I hadn't worked with themes and color variables that much before, so that.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

would like to have the "show more" button add components to the page, which is actually really easy, but i fear it might ruin my styling or something.

## 🗃️ Source
