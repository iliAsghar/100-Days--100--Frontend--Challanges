## 📖 Description

I've always wondered how these single-digit code inputs were built. In this project, I had the chance to create one! I wanted it to look like a pixel arcade game menu, so I went a little crazy with the backgrounds and fonts. It was VERY fun to make, and I hope you like it!

## 🎯 Project Goals

## 📚 What I Learned

i learned how to do the single-digit input.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

if i were to build/write this project again, I'd like to add a bit of text animations to it to make it look more 8-bit-ish.

## 🗃️ Source
