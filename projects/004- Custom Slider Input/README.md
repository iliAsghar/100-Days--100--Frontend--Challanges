## 📖 Description

In this project, I built a custom slider input with a tooltip that shows the value (0%-100%). It was a bit tricky to style because the tooltip didn’t always line up with the handle on smaller screens. I made some tweaks and got it to a pretty good place, but there might still be a tiny offset on mobile screens.

## 🎯 Project Goals

to practice styling range inputs.

## 🛠 Challenges Faced

In this project, I struggled with aligning the handle and tooltip on smaller screens. After making some adjustments with JavaScript, I think I’ve got it to a solid state.

## 📚 What I Learned

I didn't know how to style the handle and the range in a range input. so that.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

I would like to find better ways to fix the alignment issue i had.
