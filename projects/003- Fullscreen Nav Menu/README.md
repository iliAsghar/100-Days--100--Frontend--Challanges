## 📖 Description

Today's project was to build a fullscreen nav menu that expands and collapses by a hamburger menu. it was fun and kinda hard to style.
i added a cool animation on the hamburger menu.
overall it was good.

i had some difficulty disabling scroll when the menu is open. i gave up on it ( :( ), but will check it out later.

## 📚 What I Learned

I really liked the effect of expanding an element using clip-path. I'll definitely use it more.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

For this project, I wasn't feeling well, so my CSS turned out a bit messy. Maybe I'll clean it up later.
