## 📖 Description

In this project, I created a cool-looking (I think 😊) word rotation animation using only HTML and CSS. Initially, this project was not supposed to be responsive on mobile, but I tried my best to make it work. if there is any problems, please let me know.

## 🎯 Project Goals

to learn the rotation method

## 🛠 Challenges Faced

Because of the specific font family that I chose, it took me a bit of time to align everything together.
